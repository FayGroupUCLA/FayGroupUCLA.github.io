# Fay Group @ UCLA

Welcome to the Fay group website. We are a theoretical and computational chemistry research group at UCLA. The group will be starting in Summer 2025 -- so come back here soon for more information.

Until then my publications can be found on my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QTfhgdIAAAAJ&hl=en) page.
