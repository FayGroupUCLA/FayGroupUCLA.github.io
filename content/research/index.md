The Fay group explores a range of problems in chemistry. We develop theory and computational tools to tackle these problems. Whilst our interested are broad, they can be broadly categorised as below.
\[More information to be added soon.\]

## Chirality Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS)

## Electron and energy transfer

## Photosynthesis and photoprotection 

## Magnetic field effects in chemistry
