Tom can be contacted by email at *thomaspfay \[at\] ucla.edu*.

Enquiries about PhD, postdoc and undergrad research positions are always welcome!  


### PhD Applicants

Applications for PhD positions cannot be made directly to the group. All applications are made the the [UCLA Chemistry website](https://www.chemistry.ucla.edu/graduate/). Note that applications are closed for positions starting Fall 2025.
If you'd like to talk informally about potential projects in the group, feel free to contact Tom above, but again note that official applications can only be made the the [UCLA Chemistry website](https://www.chemistry.ucla.edu/graduate/). 

### Undergraduate researchers

Undergraduates interested in gaining some research experience in the group should contact Tom using the above information. 

### Postdoc Applicants

Postdoc positions are available starting from Summer/Fall 2025. Postdoc applicants should send an email explaining your interest in the group along with your CV. Projects can be tailored to your experience, interests and new skills/knowledge you wish to develop. Applicants with experience or an interest in learning biomolecular simulation, developing force-fields for excited states, or quantum dynamics are particularly encouraged to apply.

Applications are valued and encouraged from persons from groups which are generally less well represented in theoretical chemistry.
